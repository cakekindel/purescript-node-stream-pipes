-- | Convert an `AsyncPipe` to a regular `Pipe`.
-- |
-- | Rather than two concurrently-running halves (producer & consumer),
-- | this requires the `AsyncPipe` to occasionally stop `await`ing data
-- | written by the upstream `Producer` so that it can `yield` to the downstream `Consumer`.
-- |
-- | This implementation chooses to prioritize `yield`ing data to the `Consumer` over
-- | `await`ing written chunks.
-- |
-- | Note that using this limits the potential parallelism of the entire pipeline, ex:
-- |
-- | ```purs
-- | Pipe.FS.read "foo.csv"        -- read
-- |   >-> sync Pipe.CSV.parse     -- parse
-- |   >-> sync Pipe.CBOR.encode   -- encode
-- |   >-> Pipe.FS.write "foo.bin" -- write
-- | ```
-- |
-- | In the above example, this is what happens when the pipeline
-- | is executed:
-- | 1. `write` asks `encode` "do you have any data yet?" (fast)
-- | 1. `encode` asks `parse` "do you have any data yet?" (fast)
-- | 1. `parse` asks `read` "do you have any data yet?" (fast)
-- | 1. `read` passes 1 chunk to `parse` (fast)
-- | 1. `parse` blocks until the chunk is parsed (slow)
-- | 1. `parse` passes 1 chunk to `encode` (fast)
-- | 1. `encode` blocks until the chunk is encoded (slow)
-- | 1. `write` writes the block (fast)
-- |
-- | For larger workloads, changing this to use `asyncPipe` would be preferable, ex:
-- | ```purs
-- | Pipe.FS.read "foo.csv"        -- read
-- |   >-/-> Pipe.CSV.parse        -- parse
-- |   >-/-> Pipe.CBOR.encode      -- encode
-- |   >-> Pipe.FS.write "foo.bin" -- write
-- | ```
-- |
-- | With this change:
-- | * `read` will pass chunks to `parse` as fast as `parse` allows
-- | * `parse` will parse chunks and yield them to `encode` as soon as they're ready
-- | * `encode` will encode chunks and yield them to `write` as soon as they're ready

-- | Implementation of `(>-/->)`
-- |
-- | In the current `MonadFork` "thread", read data from the `AsyncPipe` as it
-- | is yielded and `yield` to the downstream `Consumer`.
-- |
-- | Concurrently, in a separate thread, read data from the upstream `Producer`
-- | and write to the `AsyncPipe` at max throughput.
-- |
-- | If the producing half fails, the error is caught and rethrown.
-- |
-- | If the consuming half fails, the error is caught, the producing half is killed, and the error is rethrown.
